Dungeonblast -- Project 3 Alpha

Brief overview of the alpha:

- Player character spawns in starting location,
along with 4 enemies in nearby locations, and
3 different pickups (fireball, ammo, health)

- currently no final sprites are in place and the
map is not quite final either (will probably need to be
scaled up to accomodate final sprites)

- enemies currently don't move, but do deal damage
to player if the player comes into contact with them

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To build:

0) Setup development environment for Windows, Linux or MacOS.
See http://dragonfly.wpi.edu/engine/index.html#setup for details.

1) Build, as appropriate for the platform (e.g., "make" on Linux or
Mac, F7 on Windows from Visual Studio).

2) Run game, as appropriate for the platform (e.g., "./game" on
Linux or Mac, F5 on Windows from Visual Studio)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Directories:

Sprites/ - contains the sprite files for the game
vs-2019/ - contains Visual Studio solution files (Microsoft Windows)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

note:
We were originally planning on using my (Ryan's) engine but I was
having some trouble with that so we ended up using the prof's engine instead.
